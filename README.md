# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This project is composed of various components, including atoms and molecules. These components, as their names suggest, contain the code that is invoked by `App.js` when necessary for rendering the components.

#index.js

In the `index.js` file, the `App.jsx` is called to handle the rendering of content on the screen.

The `App.jsx` file encompasses the main code of the program. It is responsible for fetching and processing the data to be rendered by invoking specific components on the screen when certain actions are performed. After fetching the data, it utilizes the `.then()` function, a promise function, to handle asynchronous function calls and calculate the word frequency for generating a histogram. Additionally, it includes export and clear buttons that perform operations on the rendered data. The buttons within `App.jsx` are responsible for calling the respective components.

#Components
The components consist of atoms and molecules.

#Atoms
Atoms are utilized in `App.jsx` to render data on the screen. They include a button that responds to the invocation from the `App.jsx` file. The atom component contains event handlers that handle the fetching and processing of data required for plotting the histogram. 

Additionally, it applies specific CSS styles to its attributes.


#Moelcules

Molecules are also used in `App.jsx` to render data on the screen. The molecule component consists of sub-components such as the button-group and the histogram. These sub-components receive props passed by `App.jsx` and contain event handlers for performing certian operations like plotting data in the histogram, generating downloadable files, and clearing the rendered content. 

The molecule component also utilizes specific CSS styles to define its attributes.
